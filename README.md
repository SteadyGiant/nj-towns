# nj-towns

Calculating stats for New Jersey towns. So far, just calculating density
and racial diversity.

A dataset containing the Diversity Index, population density, and other
variables for every NJ municipality is in
[`data/output/NJ_diversity_density.csv`](./data/output/NJ_diversity_density.csv).
If you want a dataset with which to run your own analysis or do calculations,
[`data/output/NJ_diversity_density_unformat.csv`](data/output/NJ_diversity_density_unformat.csv)
is the same dataset, but all variables are numeric.

See [Methodology.md](./code/Markdown/Methodology.md) for technical details.
