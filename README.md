Calculating stats for New Jersey towns. So far, just calculating density
and racial diversity.

A dataset containing the Diversity Index, population density, and other
variables for every NJ municipality is in
[`data/output/NJ_20132017_diversity_density.csv`](./data/output/NJ_20132017_diversity_density.csv).
