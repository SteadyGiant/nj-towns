# nj-towns

Calculating stats for New Jersey towns. So far, just calculating density and
racial diversity.

A dataset containing the Diversity Index, population density, and other 
variables for every NJ municipality is in 
[`data/output/NJ_diversity_density.csv`](./data/output/NJ_diversity_density.csv).

See [Methodology.md](./code/Markdown/Methodology.md).
